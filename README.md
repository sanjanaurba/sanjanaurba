ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sanjana! 

I am a third-year Computer Engineering Student at Toronto Metropolitan University. I have a strong interest in developing software to automate and optimize processes. 

  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning API integration in software development. With this new knowledge, I am working towards creating a full stack mobile app using React Native and Swift that combines Google Maps API to track a users location and alert them upon arriving at their desired destination. This allows commuters like myself to catch up on much-needed sleep while ensuring they arrive at their destination on time.
